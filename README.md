# student-course-management-system-task-uki

A **Student-Course Management System** designed to manage student registrations and their course details. 
This project demonstrates both **Python backend API development** and **Frontend UI development**, integrating a responsive interface with a **RESTful API**.  

---

## 🔹 Project Overview

This application allows users To  
- Register new students with **Name, Email, and Course**.  
- View a **list of all registered students** dynamically.  
- **Delete students** from the list.  
- Analyze student marks and generate **statistics** using a Python script (core Python logic).  

The project is split into **frontend** and **backend** Folders.  
- Frontend: Responsive UI built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**.  
- Backend: **FastAPI** handles API requests with in-memory storage (no database).  
- Core Python Script - Processes student marks for Calculate display pass/fail count, average, highest, and lowest marks.  

You can see the **live application** here: [Deployed Site](https://studentcoursemgt.netlify.app/)

## 🔹 Setup Instructions (Run Locally)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+ installed  
- Node.js and npm optional (frontend hosted separately)  
- Recommended IDE: VS Code
- Recommended VS Code Extensions: Prettier, Live Server

---
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/PeriesRFS?tab=repositories>
cd student-management-system-task-project-uki
```
### 2. Backend Setup (TASK-2)
1.Navigate to the backend folder
```bash
cd backend
```

2.Install dependencies

```bash 
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic typing
```

3.Run the FastAPI server
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
4.The backend API will run at 
#### http://127.0.0.1:8000/

### 3. Frontend Setup

- Open index.html in your browser or serve using a local server:
- Optional: Use VS Code Live Server Extension(recommended)

- Ensure script.js points to the correct backend URL (API_URL variable).
Example:
```bash
const API_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/";
```
### 4. Python Marks Analysis Script (TASK-1)

1.Navigate to the backend folder:(if you are not in the backend folder directory
```bash
cd backend
```

2.Run the marks analysis script:
```bash
python task1_manage_students.py
```
***Follow console instructions to input marks and view results.***

### 5.Deployment
